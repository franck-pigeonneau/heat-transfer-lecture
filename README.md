In fluid mechanins, exact solutions are scarce. Fortunately, particular solutions exist invariant by groups of affinity transformation. In this lecture, similar solution is presented in the Rayleigh problem. Perturbation method of a singular problem of a simple ordinary differential equation is presented. The laminar boundary layer on a flat wall is detailed. The lecture is then devoted to the heat transfer in the framework of the Boussinesq approximation. The natural convection is studied in the case of a vertical wall is heated at a constant temperature. Finally, the natural convection is studied in an square enclosure with the temperature applied on the vertical walls. To compare theoretical predictions, numerical solutions are also provided.

Apart from the lecture, this repositery gives two python files used to solved the boundary layer problems for the horizontal flat wall and for the heated vertical wall.
